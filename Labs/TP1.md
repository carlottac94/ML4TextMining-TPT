### Explain in a (very) few words the difference between regular and context-free grammars. Establish a link with the types of automaton that implement them.

A grammar is regular when its production rules are of the type A->xB or A->Bx or A->x, where A and B are non terminal symbols and x is a string of terminal symbols; it can be expressed through regular expression, and it can be generated by finite-state automata. A context-free grammar instead allows one non-terminal in their left part and any combination of terminals and non-terminals in the right part; it is a superset of regular grammar; it can be implemented through push-down automata.

### Modify the left-recursive rule `np --> np, pp.` to avoid this problem. Paste the new rule below. Does the endless loop disappear?

`np --> det, n, pp.`, yes it does.

### How many different sentences can be generated by this grammar?

An infinite number of sentences can be generated, since our grammar checks for syntactic correctness, and the rule `np --> det, n, pp` allows for infinite depth.

### Execute `bup`; you have to press `[return]` repeatedly to see what happens (comment `get0` for a smooth execution). Briefly describe the twists and turns of the analysis until the programme eventually succeeds in recognizing the sentence. How does bup process left-recursive clauses such as `np --> np, pp.` ?
