# Exercise: Text classification

Given the corpus:

` D = "the exports from Switzerland to the USA are increasing in 2006" `

`D' = "Swiss exports have increased this year" `

### 1 - Pre-processing : reduce from document to vector, from documents to matrix

Build the dictionary of the words present in the corpus

### 2 - Pre-processing : word filtering

Remove the stopwords and combine the verb belonging to the same root, to obtain the final vocabulary:

`Voc = {2006, to export, increase, Swiss, Switzerland, USA, year}`

X\_D,D' (belongs to) R^7

### 3 - Compute the vector of term frequencies of D and D'

D  = [1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

D' = [0,1,1,1,0,0,1]

### 4 - Compute the similarity between vectors

simil(D,D') = DD'/||D|| ||D'|| = 1/sqrt(5)

NB: distance = 1 - similarity
